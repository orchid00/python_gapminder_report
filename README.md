# Python Gapminder report

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/orchid00/python_gapminder_report/master?filepath=scripts%2F01_GapminderReport.ipynb)

The report is in the `scripts` folder of this repo, the file name is `01_GapminderReport.ipynb`. The Python version used is 3.6.3. 
This script uses a dataset located in the `data` folder called `gapminder_all.csv`.
If you are running this in your local computer see `requirements.txt` you need to have previously installed pandas and matplotlib.

You can also check the Python version by adding these two lines to the code

    from platform import python_version
    print(python_version())

In my case it prints `3.6.3`
